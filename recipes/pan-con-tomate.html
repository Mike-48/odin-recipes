    <h2>Description</h2>
<p>My spanish girlfriend showed me this recipe and I love it for its ease to make and freshness.
</p>

<p>Tomatoes are the stars of this dish so go with the freshest and sweetest tomatoes you can find. Tomatoes locally grown of an heirloom or beefsteak variety are great choices. Generally these types of tomatoes are large and round, and can be found at gardeners markets or organic food stores.
    They are often not sold at large grocery stores as they are harder to sell at a commercial scale. If you can't access these types of tomatoes any kind will do. I find that tomatoes on the vine can be a good choice, or roma tomatoes.
 </p>
 <h2>Ingredients</h2>
 <ul>
    <li>Ciabatta bread, or other rustic crusty bread like french bread*</li>
    <li>Extra virgin olive oil</li>
    <li>Garlic</li>
    <li>Tomatoes (heirloom or beefsteak, or whatever you have on hand)</li>
    <li>Salt & pepper</li>

 </ul>
 <h2>Steps</h2>

 <ol>
    <li>Cut ciabatta in half horizontally, then in to 2 inch strips. Toast bread slices in a toaster or oven until browned.</li>
    <li>Cut a garlic clove in half and rub cut end all over the toasted bread, using the rough surface as a kind of sandpaper. Garlic is strong when uncooked so you'll develop a feel for how much to use. I would use probably about 1/4 of
        a clove per slice of bread.
    </li>
    <li>Cut tomatoes in half horizontally and grate cut ends on a box grater until you're left with just the skin. Drain off any tomato juice left around grated tomatoes.</li>
    <li>Spoon grated tomatoes on to bread and spread evenly.</li>
    <li>Drizzle with extra virgin olive oil. Season with salt & pepper to taste</li>

 </ol>
 <h4>Notes</h4>
 <p>*You want to use harder crusty breads for this recipe, as it has a rougher surface for you to rub the garlic on. 
<p>You can spice up this recipe by adding more ingredients. A traditional addition is placing serrano ham 
    on top. In place of serrano ham I've used proscuitto as it's easier to find where I live.
