    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>The freshness of homemade pico de gallo tops anything store bought. And with the simplicity of making it I wont be going back!
    </p>
    
    <p>Eat pico de gallo with tortilla chips, or add to your favorite taco or burrito recipe for a kick of acidity and freshness. On another
        note, I recently realized how similar the ingredients are for ceviche, but that's a recipe for another time.

     </p>
     <h2>Ingredients</h2>
     <ul>
        <li>4 roma tomatoes</li>
        <li>2/3 cup white onion (about one small onion)</li>
        <li>1 cilantro bunch</li>
        <li>1 lime</li>
        <li>1 jalapeno or serrano pepper (serranos are spicier than jalapenos, omit peppers if you're not in to spice.)</li>
     
    
     </ul>
     <h2>Steps</h2>
    
     <ol>
        <li>Finely chop tomatoes, onions, jalapeno or serrano, and cilantro. Place in a bowl. </li>
        <li>Cut lime in half and squeeze each half over your mix.</li>
        <li>Season with salt to taste. I like to season, stir, season again, and taste until the salt levels are right.
        </li>
        <li>Let the mixture marinate in your fridge for 15 minutes or longer for the flavors to meld. Or eat immediately if you can't wait!</li>
    
     </ol>
     <h4>Notes</h4>
     <p>Adjust the different amounts of each ingredient to your liking. I often just eyeball how much I want to use.
