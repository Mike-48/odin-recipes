<h2>Description</h2>
<p>This recipe comes together very quickly with no cooking required. 
    It is one of my favorites my parents used to make for special occasions!
</p>
<p>It only requires a few ingredients. You may have a few already on hand, but don't forget fresh mozzarella and basil leaves 
    (you can substitue dried basil but fresh can't be beaten.) I've found that my local grocery stores sell live basil plants
    for only a few dollars. Get one and you can have fresh basil for months!
 </p>
