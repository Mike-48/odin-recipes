<h2>Description</h2>
<p>This recipe comes together very quickly with no cooking required. 
    It is one of my favorites my parents used to make for special occasions!
</p>

<p>It only requires a few ingredients. You may have a few already on hand, but don't forget fresh mozzarella and basil leaves 
    (you can substitue dried basil but fresh can't be beaten.) Fresh mozzarella is different from the blocks or grated versions often used for pizza. 
    It usually comes in a ball shape whole or presliced. It can be found next to the other fancy cheeses in grocery stores. 
    I've found that my local grocery stores sell live basil plants
    for only a few dollars. Get one and you can have fresh basil for months!
 </p>
 <h2>Ingredients</h2>
 <ul>
    <li>Baguette</li>
    <li>Fresh mozzarella</li>
    <li>Fresh basil</li>
    <li>Tomatoes</li>
    <li>Extra virgin olive oil</li>
    <li>Balsamic glaze*</li>
    <li>Salt & pepper</li>

 </ul>
 <h2>Steps</h2>

 <ol>
    <li>Cut baguette in to slices. Lay out on a cutting board or plate.</li>
    <li>Slice mozzarella and tomatoes. Layer basil, mozzarella, and tomatoes on to the baguette slices.</li>
    <li>Drizzle with extra virgin olive oil and balsamic glaze. Season with salt & pepper to taste</li>

 </ol>
 <h4>Notes</h4>
 <p>*You can use regular balsamic vinegar if you dont have balsamic glaze, or make your own glaze by simmering
    balsamic vinegar until it reduces to at least half. I prefer balsamic glaze to regular balsamic vinegar as it sticks
    to the bruschetta better and has a stronger taste.
