<h2>Description</h2>
<p>This recipe comes together very quickly with no cooking required. 
    It is one of my favorites my parents used to make for special occasions!
</p>
<p>It only requires a few ingredients. You may have a few already on hand, but don't forget fresh mozzarella and basil leaves (you can substitue dried basil but fresh can't be beaten.)
